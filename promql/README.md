## Students

To follow this course, you will need a laptop with [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started) installed.

To start the learning environment, you need to execute the following commands (make sure that your docker environment is running beforehand).

For linux/mac:
```bash
$: ./start-learning-environment.sh
```

For Windows:
```
$: cd path\to\promql\folder
$: set PROMQLWD="path\\to\\promql\\folder"
$: docker-compose up
```

If everything went ok, you are now able to access the applications:
- Grafana [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/)
- Prometheus [http://localhost:9090/](http://localhost:9090/)

You are ready to go, the course starts from [this page](docs/).

## How to add content

It's quite easy to add a new chapter or assignment. The content needs to be written into a Markdown file named after the topic.
When creating content consider these simple rules:
* keep things simple for the student
* split a chapter in multiple possibly small topics 
* the focus of each assignment should be on a specific result or learning objective (i.e. **Objective:** understand time series filtering)
* chapters and assignments should go from basic level to more advanced or expert level

New content should respect the format of the scenario:
1. state the objective at the beginning
1. explain the topic
1. write an assignment to let students put in practice what they read
1. provide a solution which is hidden by default, use the snippet below

```html
<details>
  <summary>Show solution</summary>

  **Solution**. You should have filled in: ```rate(api_request_count[1m])*10 > 150```
</details>
```
